# Quickstart: Creating a Java Function in Azure from the Command Line

## Introduction
This guide helps you make a Java function using command-line tools that respond to web requests. You'll test the code on your computer before putting it on Azure Functions, where it runs without needing a server.

## Requirements
Before you start, make sure you have:
- An Azure account
- Azure CLI (Command-Line Interface)
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Apache Maven

## Terms
- Function: It's a piece of code that performs a specific task or responds to events. In this tutorial, it's a Java function that responds to HTTP requests.
- Event: An occurrence or action that triggers the execution of a function. In this tutorial, HTTP requests are events that trigger the function.
- Components: The tutorial explains setting up the local environment, installing tools, creating a project, writing code (Function.java), configuring settings (pom.xml), running locally, deploying to Azure, invoking the function, and cleaning up resources. Each of these components plays a crucial role in developing and deploying the Java function.

## Tutorial Overview
This tutorial is based on Microsoft's [Quickstart: Create a Java Function in Azure from the Command Line](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-cli-java?tabs=windows%2Cbash%2Cazure-cli%2Cbrowser).

It covers these steps:
